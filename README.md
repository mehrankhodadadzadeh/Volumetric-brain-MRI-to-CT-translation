# Volumetric-brain-MRI-to-CT-translation
This repository contains the pipeline for volumetric MRI-to-CT synthesis using a 3D GAN-based framework trained on paired brain MRI and CT scans. The project is designed to support advanced research in cross-modality medical image synthesis and high-fidelity anatomical reconstruction
